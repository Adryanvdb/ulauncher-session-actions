### Session Actions Extension for Ulauncher


A hacky session actions extension for the [ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/).

(Formerly known as: 'ulauncher-exit-cinnamon', then I realize hardcoding things doesn't make sense.)

By default, the values it has will work only for Cinnamon DE.
You can configure this for whatever DE/WM you're using. Just check the settings.

Currently supported session actions are:

- Shutdown
- Restart
- Logout
- Suspend
- Hibernate
